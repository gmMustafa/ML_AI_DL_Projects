# Titanic EDA Project

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival rates.

## Tasks
1. Load the Titanic dataset.
2. Handle missing data.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Visualize survival rates by passenger class, gender, and age.

## Key Questions
1. What are the most significant factors affecting passenger survival?
2. How does the survival rate vary across different passenger classes?

## Instructions
1. Open the `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells to load data, perform EDA, and visualize results.

## Results
- The analysis and visualizations provide insights into the survival rates based on various factors.
