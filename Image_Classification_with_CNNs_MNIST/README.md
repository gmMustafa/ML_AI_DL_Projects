# Image Classification with CNNs

This project uses the MNIST dataset to classify images of handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Tasks
1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Build a convolutional neural network (CNN).
3. Train the CNN on the training set.
4. Evaluate the model on the test set.

## Key Questions
1. What is the accuracy of your CNN on the test set?
2. How does changing the network architecture affect performance?

## Instructions
1. Open the `Image_Classification_with_CNNs.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells to load the data, preprocess, build the CNN, train the model, and evaluate the model's performance.
3. Experiment with different CNN architectures to see how changes affect performance.

## Results
- **Test Accuracy of Initial Model**: Achieved accuracy on the test set after training the initial CNN model.
- **Test Accuracy of Modified Model**: Achieved accuracy on the test set after modifying the CNN architecture.
- **Analysis**: Comparison of performance between different architectures and insights into how network modifications impact classification accuracy.
