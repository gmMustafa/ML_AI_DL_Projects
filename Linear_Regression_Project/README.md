# Simple Linear Regression Project

This project uses the California Housing dataset to predict housing prices based on various features such as the average income, house age, and number of rooms.

## Tasks
1. Load and preprocess the housing dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a linear regression model.
4. Evaluate the model’s performance.

## Key Questions
1. What is the coefficient of determination (R²) of your model?
2. How do the different features impact the housing prices?

## Instructions
1. Open the `Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells to load data, preprocess, train the model, evaluate, and analyze feature impact.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into the impact of various features on housing prices.
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R².
